                `One day, while exploring the $SPOTLESS KINGDOM, the $KING discovered a magical $PANTERA with $GOLD fur. ` +
                `They quickly became friends and embarked on $72 exciting adventures together. ` +
                `They would $RULES through fields of $GOLD flowers and swim in crystal-clear lakes. ` +
                `The $KING was always filled with $GLORY whenever they were with their $PANTERA friend. ` +
                `One of their favorite activities was picnicking, and they would enjoy delicious $GRAPES under ` +
                `the shade of a magnificent tree. Their friendship grew stronger with each passing day, ` +
                `and they created memories that would last a lifetime. ` +
                `They would often $MUSIC together and sing their favorite song, '$THEY DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT US', while exploring new places. ` +
                `They even had a secret superhero alter ego: $ALL-MIGHT and $PANTERA, ` +
                `protecting the $SPOTLESS KINGDOM from any evil forces. Their bond was unbreakable, ` +
                `and they lived happily ever after, bringing joy and laughter to everyone they encountered. ` +
                `Whenever someone needed help, $ALL-MIGHT and $PANTERA would swoop in to save the day. ` +
                `They used their superpowers and $KING-like abilities to overcome any obstacles. ` +
                `Their bravery and kindness inspired others in $SPOTLESS KINGDOM and beyond. ` +
                `They were hailed as heroes and celebrated for their extraordinary deeds. ` +
                `Their story became legendary, passed down through generations, ` +
                `and their names were forever etched in the annals of $SPOTLESS KINGDOM's history. ` +
                `Their friendship became a symbol of hope, reminding everyone that together, ` +
                `they could achieve the impossible. And so, the adventures of $ALL-MIGHT and $PANTERA ` +
                `continued, leaving a lasting legacy of courage, friendship, and the power of dreams.`;
