This program defines a function text_extractor that takes a source file as input, extracts the text content from the file, and saves it to a new file with the "-innerText" suffix. The program then sets the source file path and calls the text_extractor function, providing the source file path. Finally, it prints the path of the new file where the extracted text is saved.


import shutil
import os

def text_extractor(source_file):
    # Read the content of the source file
    with open(source_file, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read()

    # Create a new filename with the "-innerText" suffix
    base_filename = os.path.basename(source_file)
    new_filename = os.path.splitext(base_filename)[0] + "-innerText.txt"

    # Write the extracted text to the new file
    with open(new_filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(text)

    # Return the path of the new file
    return new_filename

# Set the source file path
source_file = 'D:\\auto_py\\ch1_basics\\filename.txt'

# Extract the text and get the path of the new file
new_file_path = text_extractor(source_file)

print(f"Text extracted and saved to: {new_file_path}")
